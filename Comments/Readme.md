## Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code

### Single-Line Comments

Comments starts with a `#` (hash), amd python
will ignore them :
```python
# This is a Comment
# This is ignore python interpreter
```

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line
```python
print ("Hello") # This is a comment
```

Output:
```
Hello
```

### Multi-Line Comments

Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string ` """ ` (triple quotes) in your code, and 
place your comment inside it.

```python
"""
This is a 
Multi line
Comment
"""
```
