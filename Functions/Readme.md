### Functions

A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

**Types of functions**

- Built-in functions
- User-defined functions

#### Defining a functions

- Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).

- Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.

- The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.

- The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.

- The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.

**Syntax** :
```Python
def functionname( parameters ):
   "function_docstring"
   function_suite
   return [expression]
```

**Example** :
```Python
def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print str
   return
```

#### Calling a function

Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.

```Python

# Function definition is here
def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print str
   return;

# Now you can call printme function
printme("I'm first call to user defined function!")
printme("Again second call to the same function")
```

**Output** :
```Python
I'm first call to user defined function!
Again second call to the same function
```

#### Pass by reference vs values

All parameters (arguments) in the Python language are passed by reference. It means if you change what a parameter refers to within a function, the change also reflects back in the calling function. 

**Example** :
```Python
# Function definition is here
def changeme( mylist ):
   "This changes a passed list into this function"
   mylist.append([1,2,3,4]);
   print "Values inside the function: ", mylist
   return

# Now you can call changeme function
mylist = [10,20,30];
changeme( mylist );
print "Values outside the function: ", mylist
```

**Output** :
```
Values inside the function:  [10, 20, 30, [1, 2, 3, 4]]
Values outside the function:  [10, 20, 30, [1, 2, 3, 4]]
```

#### Function arguments

- Required arguments
- Keyword arguments
- Default arguments
- Variable-length arguments

##### Required arguments

Required arguments are the arguments passed to a function in correct positional order. Here, the number of arguments in the function call should match exactly with the function definition.

To call the function printme(), you definitely need to pass one argument, otherwise it gives a syntax error as follows

```Python
# Function definition is here
def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print str
   return;

# Now you can call printme function
printme() # empty argument throwing an error
```

**Output** :
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 11, in <module>
      printme();
TypeError: printme() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
```

##### Keywords arguments

Keyword arguments are related to the function calls. When you use keyword arguments in a function call, the caller identifies the arguments by the parameter name.

This allows you to skip arguments or place them out of order because the Python interpreter is able to use the keywords provided to match the values with parameters. You can also make keyword calls to the printme() function in the following ways

**Example** :
```Python
# Function definition is here
def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print str
   return;

# Now you can call printme function
printme( str = "My string")
```

**Output**: 
```Python
My string
```

The following example gives more clear picture. Note that the order of parameters does not matter.

**Example** :
```Python
# Function definition is here
def printinfo( name, age ):
   "This prints a passed info into this function"
   print "Name: ", name
   print "Age: ", age
   return;

# Now you can call printinfo function
printinfo( age=50, name="miki" )
```

**Output** :
```
Name:  miki
Age:  50
```

##### Default arguments 

A default argument is an argument that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument.

**Example** :
```Python
# Function definition is here
def printinfo( name, age = 35 ):
   "This prints a passed info into this function"
   print "Name: ", name
   print "Age: ", age
   return;

# Now you can call printinfo function
printinfo( age=50, name="miki" )
printinfo( name="miki" )
```

**Output** :
```
Name:  miki
Age:  50
Name:  miki
Age:  35
```

##### Variable-length arguments

You may need to process a function for more arguments than you specified while defining the function. These arguments are called variable-length arguments and are not named in the function definition, unlike required and default arguments.

**Syntax** :
```Python
def functionname([formal_args,] *var_args_tuple ):
   "function_docstring"
   function_suite
   return [expression]
```

An asterisk (*) is placed before the variable name that holds the values of all nonkeyword variable arguments. This tuple remains empty if no additional arguments are specified during the function call. Following is a simple example

**Example** :
```Python
# Function definition is here
def printinfo( arg1, *vartuple ):
   "This prints a variable passed arguments"
   print "Output is: "
   print arg1
   for var in vartuple:
      print var
   return;

# Now you can call printinfo function
printinfo( 10 )
printinfo( 70, 60, 50 )
```
**Output** :
```
Output is:
10
Output is:
70
60
50
```

##### ***Anonymous*** function 

These functions are called anonymous because they are not declared in the standard manner by using the def keyword. You can use the lambda keyword to create small anonymous functions.

- Lambda forms can take any number of arguments but return just one value in the form of an expression. They cannot contain commands or multiple expressions.

- An anonymous function cannot be a direct call to print because lambda requires an expression

- Lambda functions have their own local namespace and cannot access variables other than those in their parameter list and those in the global namespace.

- Although it appears that lambda's are a one-line version of a function, they are not equivalent to inline statements in C or C++, whose purpose is by passing function stack allocation during invocation for performance reasons.

**Syntax** :
```Python
lambda [arg1 [,arg2,.....argn]]:expression
```

**Example** :
```Python
# Function definition is here
sum = lambda arg1, arg2: arg1 + arg2;

# Now you can call sum as a function
print "Value of total : ", sum( 10, 20 )
print "Value of total : ", sum( 20, 20 )
```
**Output** :
```
Value of total :  30
Value of total :  40
```

#### The Return statement

The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.

**Example** :
```Python
# Function definition is here
def sum( arg1, arg2 ):
   # Add both the parameters and return them."
   total = arg1 + arg2
   print "Inside the function : ", total
   return total;

# Now you can call sum function
total = sum( 10, 20 );
print "Outside the function : ", total 
```

**Output** :
```
Inside the function :  30
Outside the function :  30
```

#### Variables Scope

All variables in a program may not be accessible at all locations in that program. This depends on where you have declared a variable.

The scope of a variable determines the portion of the program where you can access a particular identifier. There are two basic scopes of variables in Python âˆ’

- Global variables
- Local variables

Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope.

This means that local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed throughout the program body by all functions. When you call a function, the variables declared inside it are brought into scope. Following is a simple example.

**Example** :
```Python
total = 0; # This is global variable.
# Function definition is here
def sum( arg1, arg2 ):
   # Add both the parameters and return them."
   total = arg1 + arg2; # Here total is local variable.
   print "Inside the function local total : ", total
   return total;

# Now you can call sum function
sum( 10, 20 );
print "Outside the function global total : ", total 
```
**Output** :
```
Inside the function local total :  30
Outside the function global total :  0
```
