#### Collecting Data Points

 Let's create a program to check if there are enough data
 points within a dataset. Here's a peek at the finished code.

 Snippet: [Collecting Data Points](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/594bdb7fcf105456ad01d64940474e8995504ba2/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Collecting_Data_Points.py)

### Loops

#### Coupon Generator

 Let's use a for loop to speed up the process of creating
 multiple discount coupon codes.

 Snippet: [Coupon Generator](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/594bdb7fcf105456ad01d64940474e8995504ba2/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Coupons_Generator.py)

### Organizing Data

#### Highest Score

 Let's create some code that helps an arcade machine find
 the highest score from a list of scores without the help
 `max()`.

 Snippet: [Highest Score](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/594bdb7fcf105456ad01d64940474e8995504ba2/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Highest_Score.py)

### Using String

#### Tip Calculator

 Let's use your knowledge about data types and formatted
 string to create a tip calculator for your next evening
 out 1.

### Object-oriented Programming

#### Vending Machine Code

 Using OOP, we'll create a virtual vending machine with the
 same functionality and properties as a real-life soda machine.

Snippet: [Vending Machine Code](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/10bff116b01275c6b7d82faea8ab5ff23a042d99/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Vending%20Machine%20Code.py)

#### Archery Game

 Let's create an arcade game where users can practice archery
 and shooting arrows.

Snippet: [Archery Game](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/2eb9a50f80af7267b92355b292e6e68c8860d8d3/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Archery%20Game.py)

#### Role Playing Game

 Let's create code for a game featuring player and
 non-player characters.

Snippet: [Role Playing Game](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/a170082de623b6878ae8c40c4983bfefc069d4b5/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Role%20Playing%20Game.py)

#### Automobile Racing Game

 Let's create code that will be a part of a racing game.
 Each player can choose a different automobile to race in.

Snippet: [Automobile Racing Game](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/ae7ea001ba6f0e7174bb4f582b2c84bfd69dae7e/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Automobile%20Racing%20Game.py)

#### Food Delivery App

 Let's code part of a food delivery app. The app will
 abstracts details so the class is easy to use.

Snippet: [Food Delivery App](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/970dffada7e457372f9f3ed26d1f9dee41ce7d5e/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Food%20Delivery%20App.py)

#### Perimeter Calculator

 Let's write code that calculates the perimter of different
 polygons. The code will be part of an architectural
 design program.

Snippet: [Perimeter Calculator](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/d741a5742515d5b867f5dcc63fd4bfba9ee45f3d/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Perimeter%20Calculator.py)

#### Employee Database
