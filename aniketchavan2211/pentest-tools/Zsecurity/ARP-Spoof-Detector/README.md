## ARP-Spoof-Detector

ARP Spoofing is also known as ARP Poisoning which
is a type of cyberattack in which a malicious
user sends falsified ARP `Address Resolution Protocol`
messages over a LAN `Local Area Network`.

**before running**
- Install python3.
- Install scapy module.
- Run as superuser (administrator).

- Watch value for gateway mac in the arp table
  - Nice and simple but will not detect and attack if the tool is executed after the attack.

- Analyse `is-at` ARP responses:
  - Check if IP is gateway ip.
  - Check if source mac is actually the gateway's mac.
  - This method will detect attacks even if the attack was launched before the execution of the tool.
