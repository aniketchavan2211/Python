# Network Scanner

 **Network Scanner used for**

 - Discover all devices on the network
 - Display their `IP Address`
 - Display their `MAC Address`

## Network scanner Algorithm

 **steps:**
 1. Create `ARP` Request directed to broadcast `MAC` asking
 for `IP`.
 2. Send packet and receive respone.
 3. Parse the respone.
 4. Print result.

## Dictionares

 - Similar to lists but use key instead of index.

 **Example:**
```python
 Dictionary_name = {"key": "values", "key":"values"}
 target_client = {"mac": "00:11:22:33:44:55", "ip": "192.168.1.1", "OS": "Windows"}
```
 Python will interpret this as:

| Key |  mac  | ip | OS |
| --- | ----- | -- | -- |
| Value  | 00:11:22:33:44:55  | 192.168.1.1 |  Windows |

Elements can be accessed using their key
 ```python
 print (target_client["mac"]) # prints 00:11:22:33:44:55
 print (target_client["ip"]) # prints 192.168.1.1
 print (target_client["OS"]) # prints Windows
 print (target_client) # prints all
 ```
